Kuhn Poker:is a simple 3-card poker game .
Two players each ante 1 chip,
i.e. bet 1 chip blind into the pot before the deal.
Three cards, marked with numbers 1, 2, and 3, are shuffled,
and one card is dealt to each player and held as private information.
Play alternates starting with player 1. On a turn, a player may either pass or bet.
A player that bets places an additional chip into the pot. When a player passes after a bet,
the opponent takes all chips in the pot. When there are two successive passes
 or two successive bets, both players reveal their cards, and the player with
 the higher card takes all chips in the pot.
